subtitle: What are Third Thursdays  
---
On the Third Thursday of every month, we gather and dig deep into topics that are often treated at a surface level. 

Basically its an excuse for [Lisha Li](https://twitter.com/lishali88) and [Ben Reinhardt](https://twitter.com/Ben_Reinhardt) to be curious with our friends. 

This entire site is [open source](https://github.com/Third-Thursdays/blog), so if you want to contribute to a topic, please send a pull request.
